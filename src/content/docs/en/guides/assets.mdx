**Built-in Asset Support** is enabled in Astro behind an experimental flag. This built-in feature is intended to replace the optional `@astrojs/image` integration. The new assets experience features:

- Brand new, more intuitive `Image` component
- Automatic image optimization in Markdown and MDX files
- Integration with [Content Collections](./content-collections/)
- Improved error messages and types

:::caution
Assets are an _experimental_ Astro feature. Be mindful that the API is subject to change before it is marked as stable.
:::

## **Enabling Assets in Your Project**

To enable built-in asset support, you must add the following lines to your `astro.config.mjs` configuration file.

```diff
 // astro.config.mjs
 import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

 export default defineConfig({
+ experimental: {
+   assets: true
+ }
 });
```

## New `src/assets` directory

We recommend putting images in the `src/assets` directory. This is entirely optional, but unlocks a tighter integration with Content Collections and will be the recommended location for other asset types in the future.

Your images stored in `src/assets/` can be used by components (`.astro`, `.mdx` and other UI frameworks) and in Markdown files. 

Import them from a **relative file path** or [import alias](/en/guides/aliases/) in any component file and then use the import as the `Image` component's `src` attribute.


```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

// Access images in `src/images/`
import logo from '../assets/images/logo.png';
---
<Image src={logo} alt="Astro" />
```

### Content Collections integration

A common use case for blog posts is to reference assets in their metadata (think, cover image for an article, picture for an author etc).

With the `src/assets` folder, we're also introducing a new `asset` helper to the `astro:content` module. The `asset` helper will validate that the user references a valid asset from the `src/assets` folder:

```ts
import { asset, defineCollection, z } from "astro:content";

const blogCollection = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    image: asset({ width: 1120, height: 1120 }),
  }),
});

```

Additionally, assets referred this way will be transformed automatically to the same shape as if the image was imported, so they're ready to be used optimally.

## New signature for images imports

Previously, importing an image would return a simple `string` with the path of the image. With the new `image` features enabled, imported image assets now match the following signature:

```ts
interface ImageAsset {
  src: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  format: string;
}
```

## Features

Enabling asset support allows you to access the `astro:assets` module. This module exposes the following features:

- `Image` (see [Image Component](#image-component))

### Image Component

The `<Image>` component generates an `<img>` tag with all the necessary attributes needed to display the image while avoiding Content Layout Shift **(CLS)**.

:::tip[What is Content Layout Shift?]
CLS is a score that reflects how much content shifted on your page during loading. The ideal number for CLS is as close to zero as possible.
:::

```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import myImage from "../assets/my_image.png"; // Image is 1600x900
---

<!-- `alt` is mandatory on the Image component -->
<Image src={myImage} alt="..." />
```

```astro
<!-- Output -->
<!-- Image is optimized, proper attributes are enforced -->
<img
  src="/_astro/my_image.hash.webp"
  width="1600"
  height="900"
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="..."
/>
```

### Properties

### width and height

These properties are used to size the image while ensuring there will be no CLS. These properties are required for remote images. When using local images, the `width` and `height` can be automatically inferred from the source file.

### format

`format` is used to set the [image file type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#common_image_file_types). This property is optional, but the default is `webp`.

### quality

`quality` affects the image transformation quality. It can either be a preset from `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max` or a number from `0` to `100`. This property is optional.

### alt

Not all users can see images in the same way, so accessibility is an especially important concern when using images. Use the `alt` attribute to provide [descriptive alt text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/) for images. 

This attribute is required for the `<Image />` component. This component will throw an error if no alt text is provided.

If the image is merely decorative (i.e. doesn't contribute to the understanding of the page), set `alt=""` so that screen readers know to ignore the image.
